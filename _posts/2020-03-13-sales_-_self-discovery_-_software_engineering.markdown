I decided to pursue this part time online software engineering program in an attempt to change my career path. I graduated with a degree in Finance from Rutgers University in 2016 and have been working for a great company in sales/business development for the past 3.5 years. I love my company but realized I don't want to work in sales for much longer. Especially as I aspire to grow and advance my career, I didn't want to do that in the cutthroat environment of sales. I can't say I have been passionate about software engineering, but I was interested in it as it seemed like a field with a relatively low barrier to entry (bootcamp, online resources) where I can continuously learn and grow. I like the idea of being able to create applications that are useful to me as well as the greater community. I like the logical approach to learning concepts and finding ways to apply them in diverse way to create things and solve problems. I hope to give this my all by fully immersing myself into this over the next 10-12+ months to jumpstart my new career where I can hopefully advance quickly.
